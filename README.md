# AI Text Detection Baseline

This project builds baseline machine learning models for detecting AI-generated vs human-written text.

## Objective
- Train and evaluate text classification models
- Measure performance using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Provide a clean and reproducible baseline for further improvement

## Models
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (baseline)
- (Optional) DistilBERT fine-tuning

## Tools
Python • Scikit-learn • Jupyter/Google Colab

## Status
In progress — baseline implementation and evaluation pipeline.
