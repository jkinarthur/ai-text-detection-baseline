# AI Text Detection Baseline

Baseline machine learning models for detecting AI-generated vs human-written text.

## Objective
- Build a reproducible baseline for AI-text detection
- Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Provide a foundation for future improvements (transformers, calibration, robustness)

## Approach
**Model:** TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
**Notebook:** `ai_text_detection_baseline.ipynb`

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
